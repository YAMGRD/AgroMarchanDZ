                {"chapiter":"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave
            me some advice that Ive been turning over in my mind
            ever since.
            Whenever you feel like criticizing any one, he told me,
            just remember that all the people in this world havent had
            the advantages that youve had.
            He didnt say any more but weve always been unusually
            communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he

            meant a great deal more than that. In consequence Im in-
            clined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up

            many curious natures to me and also made me the victim
            of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to
            detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a
            normal person, and so it came about that in college I was
            unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy

            to the secret griefs of wild unknown men. Most of the con-
            fidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep,

            preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some

            unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quiver-
            ing on the horizon—for the intimate revelations of young

            men or at least the terms in which they express them are
            usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.
            Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still
            a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense
            of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at
            birth.
            And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to
            the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded
            on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point
            I dont care what its founded on. When I came back from
            the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in

            uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I want-
            ed no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses

            into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his
            name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby

            who represented everything for which I have an unaffect-
            ed scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful

            gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him,
            some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he
            were related to one of those intricate machines that register
            earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness
            had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which
            is dignified under the name of the creative temperament—
            it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness
            such as I have never found in any other person and which
            it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned
            out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what
            foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily

            closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-
            winded elations of men.

            My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in
            this middle-western city for three generations.","chpiterTitle":"Death","key":1},
