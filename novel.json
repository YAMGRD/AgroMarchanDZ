            "text":"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave
            me some advice that Ive been turning over in my mind
            ever since.
            Whenever you feel like criticizing any one, he told me,
            just remember that all the people in this world havent had
            the advantages that youve had.
            He didnt say any more but weve always been unusually
            communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he
            
            meant a great deal more than that. In consequence Im in-
            clined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up
            
            many curious natures to me and also made me the victim
            of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to
            detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a
            normal person, and so it came about that in college I was
            unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy
            
            to the secret griefs of wild unknown men. Most of the con-
            fidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep,
            
            preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some
            
            unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quiver-
            ing on the horizon—for the intimate revelations of young
            
            men or at least the terms in which they express them are
            usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.
            Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still
            a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense
            of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at
            birth.
            And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to
            the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded
            on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point
            I dont care what its founded on. When I came back from
            the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in
            
            uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I want-
            ed no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses
            
            into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his
            name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby
            
            who represented everything for which I have an unaffect-
            ed scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful
            
            gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him,
            some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he
            were related to one of those intricate machines that register
            earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness
            had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which
            is dignified under the name of the creative temperament—
            it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness
            such as I have never found in any other person and which
            it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned
            out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what
            foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily
            
            closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-
            winded elations of men.
            
            My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in
            this middle-western city for three generations."

            "text":"In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave
            me some advice that Ive been turning over in my mind
            ever since.
            Whenever you feel like criticizing any one, he told me,
            just remember that all the people in this world havent had
            the advantages that youve had.
            He didnt say any more but weve always been unusually
            communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he
            
            meant a great deal more than that. In consequence Im in-
            clined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up
            
            many curious natures to me and also made me the victim
            of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to
            detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a
            normal person, and so it came about that in college I was
            unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy
            
            to the secret griefs of wild unknown men. Most of the con-
            fidences were unsought—frequently I have feigned sleep,
            
            preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by some
            
            unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quiver-
            ing on the horizon—for the intimate revelations of young
            
            men or at least the terms in which they express them are
            usually plagiaristic and marred by obvious suppressions.
            Reserving judgments is a matter of infinite hope. I am still
            a little afraid of missing something if I forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly repeat a sense
            of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out unequally at
            birth.
            And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to
            the admission that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded
            on the hard rock or the wet marshes but after a certain point
            I dont care what its founded on. When I came back from
            the East last autumn I felt that I wanted the world to be in
            
            uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I want-
            ed no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses
            
            into the human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his
            name to this book, was exempt from my reaction—Gatsby
            
            who represented everything for which I have an unaffect-
            ed scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of successful
            
            gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him,
            some heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he
            were related to one of those intricate machines that register
            earthquakes ten thousand miles away. This responsiveness
            had nothing to do with that flabby impressionability which
            is dignified under the name of the creative temperament—
            it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a romantic readiness
            such as I have never found in any other person and which
            it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned
            out all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what
            foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily
            
            closed out my interest in the abortive sorrows and short-
            winded elations of men.
            
            My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in
            this middle-western city for three generations."

            The fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he
            was known. His acquaintances resented the fact that he
            turned up in popular restaurants with her and leaving her
            at a table sauntered about chatting with whomsoever he
            knew. Though I was curious to see her I had no desire to
            meet her—but I did. I went up to New York with Tom on the
            train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps
            he jumped to his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally
            forced me from the car.
            Were getting off! he insisted. I want you to meet my
            girl.

            determination to have my company bordered on violence.

            I had nothing better to do.

            motor-road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside
            it for a quarter of a mile so as to shrink away from a certain
            desolate area of land. This is a valley of ashes—a fantastic
            farm where ashes grow like wheat into ridges and hills and
            grotesque gardens where ashes take the forms of houses and
            
            chimneys and rising smoke and finally with a transcen-
            dent effort of men who move dimly and already crumbling
            
            through the powdery air. Occasionally a line of grey cars
            crawls along an invisible track gives out a ghastly creak and
            comes to rest and immediately the ash-grey men swarm up
            with leaden spades and stir up an impenetrable cloud which
            screens their obscure operations from your sight.
            But above the grey land and the spasms of bleak dust
            which drift endlessly over it you perceive after a moment
            the eyes of Doctor T. J. Eckleburg. The eyes of Doctor T. J.
            Eckleburg are blue and gigantic—their retinas are one yard
            high. They look out of no face but instead from a pair of
            enormous yellow spectacles which pass over a nonexistent
            nose. Evidently some wild wag of an oculist set them there
            to fatten his practice in the borough of Queens and then
            sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them
            and moved away. But his eyes dimmed a little by many
